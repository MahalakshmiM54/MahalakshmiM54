#####Emotion Detection Using Facial Recognition
This project is a Python-based Emotion Detection system that uses facial expressions to identify human emotions such as Happy, Sad, Angry, Neutral, and more. It combines computer vision and deep learning techniques to recognize emotions in real-time from webcam feed or images.

###### Features
Real-time emotion detection using webcam

Detects emotions like: Happy, Sad, Angry, Neutral, Surprised, Fear, and Disgust

Uses OpenCV for face detection

Trained with a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)

Dataset: FER-2013 (Facial Expression Recognition)

#####Technologies Used
